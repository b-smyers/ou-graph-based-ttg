Topics are chosen to provide a wide breadth and scope of black visual and expressive culture. \r\n\r\nThe course is interdisciplinary by design and necessity. Encourages a shift of hermeneutics from the black life world to black visual and expressive culture in the terms of blackness. This means repurposing the study of black art in ways other than fidelity to the social category of race and an ethics of positive and negative representation that tacitly encourages the idea of film as cultural policy. Details a commitment to how new paradigms for form and aesthetics, historiography, and intertextuality constitute blackness as the unfinalizable encounter between the idea of race and the idea of art rather than blackness as merely sociology.\r\n\r\nThe approach of this course is primarily that of visual culture and post-structuralist work devoted to difference.

We will use an intersectionality perspective to explore the relationships between multiple dimensions of social relations and inequalities: gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation.  We will also consider how black masculinities are produced in various physical/social sites. This course evaluates the prospects for social change in how black men think, feel, and act.  It addresses issues such as: black male socialization and boyhood/guyland culture, the black male body image, black male friendship, black male sexuality and fertility, black men's experiences as fathers and their involvement in volunteer and paid youth work, male aggression and violence, the social construction of masculinities in different historical and cultural contexts, and men's movements and networks.

Encourages a shift of hermeneutics from the black life world to black visual and expressive culture in the terms of blackness. This means repurposing the study of black art in ways other than fidelity to the social category of race and an ethics of positive and negative representation that tacitly encourages the idea of film as cultural policy. Details a commitment to how new paradigms for form and aesthetics, historiography, and intertextuality constitute blackness as the unfinalizable encounter between the idea of race and the idea of art rather than blackness as merely sociology.\r\n\r\nThe approach of this course is primarily that of visual culture and post-structuralist work devoted to difference.

We will use an intersectionality perspective to explore the relationships between multiple dimensions of social relations and inequalities: gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation.  We will also consider how black masculinities are produced in various physical/social sites. This course evaluates the prospects for social change in how black men think, feel, and act.  It addresses issues such as: black male socialization and boyhood/guyland culture, the black male body image, black male friendship, black male sexuality and fertility, black men's experiences as fathers and their involvement in volunteer and paid youth work, male aggression and violence, the social construction of masculinities in different historical and cultural contexts, and men's movements and networks.

What was the role of religion? of education? of art? How did Romans deal with death? What ultimately made life worth living for an ancient Roman? We will study the political lives of Roman elites, the rituals of daily life, and the art and architecture that made up the environment in which these people lived. These issues are then compared with our own attitudes in modern America in an attempt to understand differences and commonalities shared by human beings in different cultures.

Women's roles were tied to reproduction and care of the household, and women were seen as less publicly productive, and therefore inferior to men. The ways in which women were categorized as 'not men' cannot be understood without analyzing what it meant to be a man in these societies, in particular a free citizen adult man. The evidence we will consider includes economic and legal texts, literature, religious texts and funerary inscriptions, as well as archaeological evidence. In particular, we will look at the representations of women in epic, love poetry, drama, law cases, art and archaeology. Most texts and art works were created by men, and present the male view, both positive and negative, of women's roles in society, so the course will also focus upon the culturally defined gender biases in the sources, and on feminist methodologies devised to clarify and interpret these biases.", "capacity": 25, "note": "In-person/on-site attendance is required.
